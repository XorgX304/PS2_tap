PS/2 Tap
========

A PS/2 data tap over audio line in.

Why?
----
I thought it would be a fun thing to do.

How?
----
PS/2 keyboards transmit data at between 11 and 16 kHz, which is easily within
range of every modern sound card.  This board and software allow a user to tap
a PS/2 line and read the transmitted keyboard data via the line in socket on the
host.

The data could also be transmitted over a radio link, although loss in quality
would hamper decoding of the data.
